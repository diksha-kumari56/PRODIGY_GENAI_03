# PRODIGY_GENAI_03 – Text Generation using Markov Chains

## 💼 Task
This is Task 03 of my Generative AI Internship at *Prodigy Infotech*.  
In this task, I implemented a simple *text generator using Markov Chains*.

## 🛠 What I Did
- Read and processed a text dataset
- Built a Markov Chain model based on word transitions
- Generated random but readable text sequences
- Displayed the generated outputs

## 📸 Output

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- random module for Markov chain generation
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📚 What I Learned
- How Markov Chains can be used for probabilistic text generation
- Difference between rule-based and statistical generation
- Implementing logic for simple yet powerful AI applications
